### SQL Queries

- `create_tables.sql`: Contains the SQL commands to create the database and tables.
- `select_queries.sql`: Contains sample SQL queries to interact with the data.

### Connecting Database to Python

- The database ‘coworking’ was connected to Python using a Jupyter Notebook.
- Performed analytics to provide insights into how ‘SmartSpaces’ can expand their services across Boston.
- Metrics like ‘Recurring Users’, capacity of neighborhoods, and revenue generated were analyzed to assist in decision-making.
